# Assignment 2 Questions

Please answer the following questions.  There are no "wrong" answers, but:
  * Some will help us understand your work habits,
  * Some will help us understand your work, and
  * Some may help you identify deficiencies in your work.

***Q1.0 Can you describe any errors or bugs that you found particularly time consuming or challenging?***

1. The passing of functions and parameters gave me the most trouble for sure. It's an absolute pain. "" or '' or just the name...



***Q1.1 If applicable, were there any special programming techniques or tools you used to assist you with the bugs/challenges in the previous question?***

1. console.log forever hehe, and creating debug buttons

***Q1.2 Errors/bugs are unavoidable, but in hindsight are there any techniques/approaches that you could have used (but didn't) that would have helped you with the bugs/challenges?***

1. I changed it now, but I should have used flexible function(parameter) functions from the beginning

***Q1.3 Were there any significan misunderstandings (i.e., not a typo) that deterred your progress on this?  If so, can you describe them?***

1. How functions with parameters work. I spent vast majority of my time understanding the effect that functions actually have. Same for using setTimeout to pass functions.

***Q2 Do you have any suggestions that would help future students with this assignment?***

1. Read the rubric. Don't be afraid to completely start over instead of trying to retrofit bad/broken design choices.

***Q3.0 If you worked in a group, did you use pair programming?***

***3.1 If you didn't use pair programming, skip to question 3.2.  If you did, in the following table give each person's name and an estimate of the percent of total time they spent as a "driver":***

| Name  |  % of Time as Driver |
|:------|:---------------------|
|  ???  | ???                  |
|  ???  | ???                  |

***Q3.2 If you used pair programming, skip this question.  If you didn't, explain how you divided up the work and how each person contributed:***

1. Did it solo from basically scratch.

***Q4. Assignment Checklist.  Below is a Markdown style Task List. The Tasks correspond to many of the major features of the assignment. Filling in the checklist will help ensure that you have completed many of the major elements of the assignment (although it does not cover every point possible)***

- [x] This is an example of a completed task.  Note the "x" in the brackets.
- [ ] And this is not complete yet...

# Assignment 2 Task List

Add the "x"s to each task/component you've completed:

- [ x] Single page style app
- [x ] Tested transitions between all required pages of your app.
- [ x] Verified that the `garage` object is not directly interacting with any DOM elements or any part of the UI.
- [ x] Verified that the UI logic doesn't directly change and properties of the `garage` object. (All interactions go through methods)
- [ x] Tested that any change in state will be reported correctly to the UI.  That is, the UI is always in sync with the state of the simulated garage.
- [no delay..my code is set up differently 8) ] Verified the timing requirements (states of the door motion each take 1s;  there's also a 1s delay in reporting any state changes to the UI)
- [x ] Ensured that the UI is non-blocking.
- [ x] Tested the auto-close feature.
- [ x] Tested the ability to enable/disable the auto-close feature.
- [ x] Tested the auto-off feature of the light.
- [ ] Reviewed the demo videos and match the basic behaviors shown.
- [ x] Verified that any change in state will be reflected in the UI.
- [ x] Completed the `README.md` :smile:
- [x ] Committed your code and pushed it to GitHub
- [x ] Verified your final code is on GitHub
